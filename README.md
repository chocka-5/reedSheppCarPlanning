#  Efficient Path Planning for Non-Holonomic Vehicles in the Presence of Environmental Disturbances

Developed Control based A* (CBA*) star Algorithm for Non- Holanomic vehicles namely Dubins Car and Reed-Sheep Car with environment disturbances.Ran Over 100 simulations with varying each parameter like obstacle density , vehicle velocity , grid resolution and wind
velocity .Used Nonlinear Guidance Law as path following controller for converting gridded to clustered environment.Compared our algorithm with kinodynamic RRT* algorithm with the same constraints for path cost, success rate and computation time.
